<h3>The waterboy</h3>
<p>
   The Waterboy (1998) is a sports comedy starring Adam Sandler as Bobby Boucher, a socially awkward and overly sheltered waterboy for a college football team. Bobby, who has been bullied his whole life, is extremely passionate about providing water for the team, but he’s constantly ridiculed and mistreated.

After getting fired from his original job, Bobby joins a struggling football team, the South Central Louisiana State University Mud Dogs, led by Coach Klein (Henry Winkler). One day, out of frustration, Bobby tackles a player with incredible force, revealing a hidden talent for football. Coach Klein recruits him as a linebacker, and Bobby becomes a dominant force on the field, helping turn the team’s season around.

Despite his success, Bobby has to keep his football career a secret from his overprotective and controlling mother (Kathy Bates), who believes all sports are dangerous. As Bobby gains confidence, he also reconnects with his childhood crush, Vicki Vallencourt (Fairuza Balk), who encourages him to stand up for himself.

Filled with Sandler’s signature goofy humor, exaggerated characters, and heartfelt moments, The Waterboy is a classic underdog story about finding confidence, overcoming adversity, and proving that even the most unlikely person can achieve greatness.
